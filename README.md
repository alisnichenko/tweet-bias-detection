# tweet-bias-detection
Twitter's #Codechella submission for bias detection in tweets using Python and RNNs.

# Overview
We are a team of 2, working on Twitter's #Codechella project. Hopefully, we
will present a project that works, tackles a problem, and innovative enough to
be recognized by Twitter Engineers. Good luck to us!

# Technologies used (tentative)
Here is a list of technologies that are going to be utilized in the project:

1. Python (programming language).
2. Flask (web framework for Python).
3. TensorFlow/Keras (machine learning framework for Python).
4. HTML/CSS (web-based presentation component).

Installation directions for future use will be delivered later.

# Timeline (tentative)
The following is a brief timeline of our project and the associated tasks that
we want to accomplish:

1. Repository and infrastructure setup (due November 19/20).
2. Data collection and filtering (due November 20/21).
3. Machine learning model and training (due November 21 sharp).
4. Hosting, website, video, and presentation (due November 22 by 9am EST sharp).

More info on each item is in the section below.

# Todos (tentative)
The following is a detailed and ever-changing list of todos that we must complete
in order to have a project that we are able to present. Please keep it updated and
modified according to our needs. Details are very important.

**Repository** - the first major todo due November 19/20.
- [x] Create github repository.
- [x] Add basic README.md with tasks and technologies.
- [ ] Find necessary links for the development (ML articles, tutorials, etc).
- [x] Agree on goals and deadlines.
- [x] Decide on the style of collaboration and split the tasks.

**Data collection** - the second stage of the project. Due November 20/21.
- [x] Get Twitter API access.
- [ ] Setup Twitter API authentication.
- [ ] Send the first request using Python.
- [ ] Obtain tweets from each account of interest (Trump, AP, NIH, etc.).
- [ ] Assign labels to the obtained tweets and store them together.
- [ ] Verify the use case for data and filter the data.

**Machine learning model** - due November 21 sharp.
- [ ] Find an article that describes the network.
- [ ] Install pretrained models.
- [ ] Develop the input format of the model.
- [ ] Develop the architecture of the model.
- [ ] Run the first tests on Google Collab or Google Cloud.
- [ ] Run sample tweets to showcase the results.

**Presentation** - due November 22 by 9am.
- [ ] Create a document with explanations for the submission.
- [ ] Create a video 3-5 minutes on YouTube for devpost submission.
- [ ] Setup a quick github page with the demonstration of the tweet bias detection.
- [ ] Setup a quick flask api with CSS/HTML styling for the service.
- [ ] Win the hackathon.

Below are the links for the project.
